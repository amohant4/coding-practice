\section{Getting started}


Python is object-oriented programming language with powerful built-in data types. Since Python is an interpreted language, it is most easily reviewed by simply looking at and describing interactive sessions. To start a python interactive session, open command prompt and enter python.
In this book we will be using python 2.7 for all examples. It is assumed that you have a linux based system with python 2.7 already installed in it. Lets begin with the all famous "Hello world" program:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> print 'hello world'
hello world
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Merge two sorted linked lists}
Write a SortedMerge() function that takes two lists, each of which is sorted in increasing order, and merges the two together into one list which is in increasing order. SortedMerge() should return the new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
